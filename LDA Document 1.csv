1,"The shock of Russia?s full-scale invasion has been replaced, one year on, by horror at the toll that it has taken on Ukraine. Tens of thousands of lives have been lost, including those of civilians; tens of thousands have been injured, and more bear psychological scars. The country?s infrastructure has been pulverised. In September, an estimate suggested that rebuilding Ukraine would cost upwards of $349bn, a figure that will have risen sharply. Millions have fled their homes and often their country too.

The reverberations of Vladimir Putin?s attack have been felt, too, far beyond its borders. This illegal act of aggression has entrenched a growing food crisis, claiming more lives and threatening stability in other nations. Its reshaping of international relations will define the decades to come.

?The whole world faced a test for the age,? Joe Biden said in Warsaw this week. ?The world would not look the other way.? The west rightly threw its weight behind Ukraine. Mr Putin did not expect the full scale of sanctions to hit Russia, nor the breadth of condemnation. On Thursday, the UN general assembly was expected to pass another resolution demanding Russia?s unconditional withdrawal by an overwhelming majority.

Yet this was never, as some initially portrayed it, simply a story of Russia against the rest ? nor even, as many in the west still believe, the emergence of a bipolar world in which the west and allied democracies face off against a Chinese-Russian bloc. (The Sino-Russian relationship is itself complex despite its strengthening, as China continues to try to straddle conflicting interests.) India abstained on a previous denunciation of Moscow at the general assembly; many of the countries that backed the resolution ? such as Brazil ? were unwilling to take further action.

Many leaders and publics in the global south, even in democracies, are cynical about grand declarations by western leaders that they are backing Ukraine solely to defend democracy. This is partly historical. South Africa has been conducting military exercises with Russia and China; the ruling ANC received Soviet and Chinese support when the west turned a blind eye to apartheid. People point to the US and its allies backing dictators and toppling elected leaders and the disastrous invasion of Iraq.

The sense of hypocrisy is heightened by the lack of attention in the west to what has probably been a much deadlier war in Ethiopia, and the welcome given to Ukrainians compared with other refugees. For many, a swift end to the conflict also looks more attractive than the best outcome for Ukrainians. Russia seems no threat to them, and soaring food prices have hit the world?s poorest the hardest.

The contrast in perspectives stretches beyond the war itself to the kind of world that lies beyond it. Research published by the European Council on Foreign Relations shows that while Europeans and Americans think the future will probably be defined by US- and Chinese-led blocs, people in China, India, Turkey and Russia foresee a multipolar world, in which many powers shape outcomes. The report?s authors point to a paradox: while the war has consolidated the west, the international realm is diversifying. Unlike in the cold war, trade and security partners may be quite distinct. Instead of looking back to the past, the west must prepare for the future. As repugnant as Mr Putin?s war is, moralising about other countries? responses will be less useful than recognising and reflecting on the distinct interests of rising powers."
2,"Russia?s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began a year ago this week, was an extraordinary and unexpected event that has changed the world in which we live. Long-held assumptions about peace in Europe, post-cold war relations with Moscow and Nato?s diminished standing were shattered overnight. The war has revolutionised German defence policy, silenced French talk of ?strategic autonomy?, boosted EU unity, revived US commitment to the transatlantic alliance, dramatised the global north-south divide, reduced the UN to the role of hand-wringing bystander and given the UK an opportunity, after Brexit, to show it still has an international role to play.

The fallout from Russia?s illegal, unprovoked attack, ordered by its president, Vladimir Putin, has caused immense economic and social disruption reaching beyond Europe. Vital grain exports from Ukraine to Middle Eastern and African countries faced a Black Sea naval blockade. Fragile, post-Covid global supply chains were further damaged, fuelling a cost of living crisis. Europe?s over-dependence on Russian gas and oil was painfully exposed. As western sanctions bit, Putin deliberately weaponised energy prices, attempted nuclear blackmail and sought a closer alliance with China. Under air and missile attack, millions of refugees fled Ukraine. Thousands of civilians have died ? and are still dying.

The war has revealed the divided loyalties and moral confusion of many fence-sitting governments, including India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey. It also delivered a cruel blow to the foundations of international law: the UN charter and a paralysed security council. While both sides are accused of atrocities, the behaviour of many Russian soldiers, involving murder, torture and systemic rape, has been and is appalling. Investigations into Russian war crimes, genocide and the crime of aggression are in train. But it remains uncertain whether those chiefly responsible, from Putin down, will face justice.

The fact the sovereign, democratic nation of Ukraine has survived, unbowed and unconquered, is possibly the most remarkable outcome of the conflict so far. Few expected it to hold out for more than a few days. Then again, few expected the mighty Russian army to perform as incompetently as it did in the weeks after 24 February 2022. It squandered the advantages of superior numbers and surprise, lost vast amounts of men and materiel, and was forced, humiliatingly, to withdraw north of Kyiv. Last autumn, it suffered additional, significant battlefield reverses. The performance of Ukraine?s defenders has been inspirational and heroic.

Ukraine?s physical survival, despite significant losses of territory, has been matched by psychological triumph. For this, much credit goes to its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has campaigned tirelessly to whip up international support. The countries of Europe, and the EU as an institution, have rallied round in an unexpected, gratifying display of solidarity. Gifts of weapons, cash aid, technology, expertise and shelter have poured in, along with volunteers, military and civilian. In contrast, morale among Russia?s army and public has slumped as promises of a quick victory were replaced by the prospect of a long struggle. Their disillusion was rendered more bitter by Putin?s blunders and lies, enforced mobilisations and brutal suppression of anti-war protests.

But, and it?s a big ?but?, it is plain the war is far from over and may be entering an even more dangerous phase. Russia?s ill-led, ill-equipped and ill-disciplined forces have regrouped and reinforced. Their anticipated spring offensive along the eastern or southern fronts, or possibly via Belarus, may already be gathering pace and Moldova is also threatened with destabilisation. It has been clear for some time that Ukrainian forces are on the back foot in key strategic locations. Despite more pledges of sophisticated western arms, missile systems and tanks, they are reportedly struggling to hold back the invaders.

Almost 100 US, European and Nato leaders meeting at this weekend?s Munich security conference (from which Russia, unusually, has been excluded) appear to understand a critical moment is approaching. Zelenskiy is demanding urgent action to help Ukraine weather the coming storm. Rishi Sunak is listening. He urged western countries to join the UK in ?doubling down? on military support, and to offer Kyiv a closer, long-term relationship within Nato and the EU. Britain can be proud of the support it has given Ukraine, which included œ2.3bn in military aid last year. Unlike Boris Johnson, his Churchill-imitating predecessor, Sunak has not sought to exploit the war for personal political purposes.

Dark clouds hang over this life-or-death struggle as it enters a second year. Western weapons continue to be slow in arriving. There are still no combat planes. Meanwhile, political strains increase. Although President Joe Biden, who will mark the war?s anniversary in Warsaw on Tuesday, has provided the lion?s share of arms and aid to Ukraine, both he and Nato have been too cautious in confronting Russia. Yet rightwing Republicans and some US voters believe Biden has gone too far. France?s ever-flexible president, Emmanuel Macron, who was accused of appeasement a year ago, is now insisting Putin be defeated militarily. But despite fierce east European pressure, Germany?s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stubbornly insists on treading warily. Most Germans now favour peace talks, even if they entail territorial concessions.

The wider debate concerns how this war ends. What, exactly, is the western democracies? endgame? There is as yet no agreement. Future scenarios include a Ukrainian victory and/or 1917-style Russian collapse, total defeat for Ukraine, escalation leading to direct Nato-Russia conflict in Europe, expanding warfare across the country, or a frozen conflict ? in effect, a stalemate ? similar to the situation after Russia?s 2014 invasion of Crimea and the Donbas. Only the latter outcome could lead, hypothetically, to the negotiated settlement many western politicians and analysts believe must eventually be attained.

Any such future ?peace? deal would necessarily involve painful Ukrainian concessions. It would be seen by many, in Kyiv and Europe, as a betrayal, and by Putin as a vindication. That is a dreadful thought. But we are not there yet, and may never be. Right now, both sides are intent on strengthening their positions through military successes. So the war goes on."
3,"Nine years ago, Maidan, the main square of my home city Kyiv, was filled with people carrying EU and Ukrainian flags. Maidan, or the Revolution of Dignity, was the last successful European democratic revolution. The protesters won. They ? we ? managed to overthrow a regime that was actively preparing Russia?s political annexation of Ukraine. Nine years ago, the human ocean of Maidan carried on its shoulders the coffins of activists who had been shot dead by police. The tragedy was immense but the space for mourning was limited: the annexation of Crimea began and we realised that the Kremlin had gone to war against Ukraine, against us.

We learned then that achieving the impossible might be romantically beautiful in songs or movies. It came at a price, however, a price that was too high from the very beginning. But that image of Maidan filled with European flags remained a point of reference and a symbol of the change we sought. Social togetherness and community, democratisation and responsible citizenship were our goals.

Yet now, these citizens, these people who waved European flags, are sinking into the ocean of a war of extermination.

Where are most Ukrainian flags now? They fly in the cemeteries of our cities and towns, where funerals take place non-stop.

Genocide is being perpetrated on my country as punishment for those Ukrainians who persisted in, and still insist on, their own political subjectivity. Flags on Ukrainian graves illustrate the Putinist idea of counter-revolution. Seen from the Kremlin, the desire for change must be crushed. Maidan should rest in war. Putin?s physical hatred of Ukraine is not just ethnic, it is political. What we witness is the physical extermination of life and time.

Since our military authorities keep silent about Ukrainian losses, avoiding these statistics of horror for strategic reasons, the cemetery with its newly planted woods of flags is where the body count becomes concrete, visible and speaks the truth of death.

The truth is that there is a country in Europe where the deaths of hundreds of people every day is considered bearable. The living ? if they are not male and aged between 18 and 60, or living under Russian occupation ? can freely cross its borders. They are accepted by other European states. Within Ukraine?s borders however death becomes more and more concentrated.

Even before Russia?s full-scale invasion, I often heard people refer to Ukraine as Europe?s back yard. Now it resembles a graveyard, the war itself a gravedigger ? missiles and shells form huge pits, digging graves for Ukrainians themselves. This cemetery is planted with beautiful flowers ? notions of unbreakability, courage and resilience, which should give hope, the promise of rebuilding and that life is possible after all the horror.

A few weeks ago, I crossed the border between Ukraine and the European Union. Today there are no fast connections to or from Ukraine. The long journey has its own logic: the mental transformation takes time. In order to move from peace to war or from war to peace, one has to travel through a process, out of accelerated time ? where the countdown applies not to seconds, but to human lives ? into a time where there is room for reflection and discussion (sometimes just the wasting of words) and, most importantly, where there is time for choice. This mental metamorphosis creates anxiety, fear, disrupts sleep and deprives you of the most basic confidence in the ground under your feet, even when this ground is no longer dug up by shells and grave shovels. The borderline is felt as a kind of mental disorder.

Perhaps the current Nato strategy of supporting Ukraine in doses can be viewed through the prism of the fatal political logic of the borderline. The repressed can wait. But for how long? For me, being inside the borderline means being haunted by a question: What would anti-war politics look like if the bloody slaughter was not taking place on the margins of Europe?

The truth of death is to see it without the embellishment of heroic rhetoric and admiration for dignity and courage. It is often said of Ukrainians, and they themselves say it, that they have lost their fear. Yes, giving up the fear of death can be the key to freedom. But does Europe attribute to us the virtues of courage and indomitability because our territory is frightening in its proximity? Does Ukraine strike fear by asserting its identity, which can?t be accepted into the inner self and so must be kept on the other side of the border?

Overcoming that border thus becomes a question of peace. To integrate Ukraine into Europe as soon as possible, to accept Ukraine, means to integrate the repressed. If the catastrophe of genocide and the nightmare of war became part of Europe?s experience, the desire to stop the dying might manifest very differently.

When my colleagues comment on Russia?s war against Ukraine, they talk about our history of Russian imperialism, Russification, about Stalinism and colonisation. For me, this war has a clear point of reference ? the Maidan. Perhaps it is worth returning to this place to find the future. Our common future. The last European revolution, which has not ? not yet ? received its proper place in the history of Europe. Maidan was a signal from people on the margins of Europe that peace and justice, key goals of the European Union, require a complex, sensitive and inclusive construction. But was that signal noticed?

he idea of radical transformation seems to be in the air, but the political and strategic decision-making process in Europe is now influenced by fear. This fear will corrode and slowly suffocate the new impulses. Because the willingness to fight for Ukraine means challenging the death that Russia is so fatally in love with today.

I feel that in its collective imagination, Europe is on the threshold, ready to step into the future. It is rediscovering itself, rethinking the subjectivity of its eastern-European part and looking beyond its own protected borders. I believe in a European victory, a joint victory over contemporary Russian fascism, which to some extent also manifests in the growth of rightwing radical movements and sentiments throughout Europe.

Today European cities are full of Ukrainian flags. But what does their presence mean? Do these flags represent the revolutionary future or rather its commemoration? Is Ukraine supposed to be a dead hero or a living partner? It?s time to decide."
4,"If the outcome of the war could be determined by the toss of a coin, the camps would be clear: democracies would want Ukraine to win, autocracies would want it to lose. But real-world political outcomes are not so binary. They typically fall on a spectrum between annihilation and total victory. This leaves the democracies divided into at least three camps: the English-speaking, the western European and the eastern European minus Hungary. What Putin calls the ?collective west? all want Ukraine to win. But not necessarily to the same extent.

For Poland and the Baltic countries the matter is simple. They want Ukraine?s victory to be unequivocal. The advantages would be both material and psychological.

Ukraine?s victory would soothe a centuries-old angst. For Poland, Russia has augured conquest, partitions, genocide, colonialism and communism. The obsession is mutual. In his 2021 essay arguing that Ukraine and Russia were historically one people, Putin included more than 30 references to Poland ? some hinting that Ukrainian national identity was plotted by Poland?s elites. Over the past 600 years, Russia and Poland have waged more than a dozen wars. There is little love lost between them.

Ukraine?s success would also entail a historic chance for the region to exit the status of the periphery and become a counterbalance to the EU?s big western member states. Victory in Ukraine would probably spill over into regime change in Belarus ? the second missing piece in the historic project of the Intermarium, or a buffer of allied countries stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea to counterbalance Russia?s power.

For Poland, such a scenario would be a double jackpot. For the first time since at least the 17th century, we would get over the problem of ?the neighbourhood? ? a comfort that most western Europeans have taken for granted since the end of the second world war. A united region across eastern Europe, with the human and economic capacity of more than 100 million citizens, could offset the dominance of the old Rhineland in the EU.

This possibility is why the Kremlin systemically underplays the region?s potential. Its rhetoric treats Ukraine as nothing more than a repository of Slavic peasant folklore, a superpower only in handicrafts. In reality, Ukraine, birthplace of Sergei Prokofiev and Sergei Korolev, the father of Soviet space exploration, hosts swathes of unexploited natural resources, a potential for emissions-free electricity, some of the continent?s most fertile soils, a space and aviation industry that has built the world?s largest aeroplane, and political leaders who command respect across Europe.

Tapping into that potential requires economies of scale, transparent institutions and capital investments. Some of this scale could come from regional integration with its allies. Curbing corruption and the power of the oligarchs was already very much on the agenda of the Zelenskiy administration. With victory, investment money would flow.

Poland and Ukraine are much poorer today than France and Germany. How could they realistically become a countervailing force in the future EU? Like many postwar economic miracles ? such as those of South Korea, Japan and West Germany ? this one is also likely to be co-sponsored by a superpower with much to gain from the reconfigured political order.

The US is already pumping money, technologies and thinktanks in to eastern Europe. In return, it expects influence and a clear stance on China. This is a price that seems too high to Europe?s west but not to its east. Lithuania was ready to risk trade relations with China to please the US, while Ukraine and the Czech Republic have pivoted to sourcing nuclear fuel from the US. Poland recently contracted with an American company to build its first nuclear power plant.

Western Europeans might not be ready for the geopolitical centre of gravity to shift eastward ? let alone at the price of increased US influence across the continent.

After the cold war, western Europe became a reluctant ally of the US and the main beneficiary of a post-Berlin Wall triangulation: Russian energy, Chinese markets and American security. Now the first pillar is gone and the second may be the price to pay for the third.

France and Germany currently endorse a policy of ?strategic autonomy? for Europe, a defence and security idea that could one day lead to an EU army. Putin?s Russia has pushed the goal of a Eurasian union stretching ?from Vladivostok to Lisbon?. What both strategies have in common is an aversion to ?Anglo-Saxon? dominance in Europe.

American and eastern European interests today seem aligned. There are two looming reasons why they may diverge. First, the US is way more afraid of a repeat of the chaos of the 1991 Soviet Union implosion, and the attendant risks to nuclear security. These security risks are not taken lightly in eastern Europe. But if you already live in an at-risk neighbourhood and there?s the possibility of major improvement, your perspective can be different.

Second, there seems to be a residual hope in the US that, as long as Russia stands on its feet, it can eventually be pivoted towards the west and used against China ? in a reverse Kissinger manoeuvre. In eastern Europe, this idea is greeted with horror. It has been tested many times with Putin (too many ? if you ask eastern Europeans). The region fears that it could be tried again with Putin?s successor ? especially if Russia, in lieu of major reforms, pulls out of a hat someone such as Alexei Navalny, aesthetically acceptable for the west but still wedded to Russia?s role as a great power.

But these are opportunities and risks, not givens. Poland?s Law and Justice party ? bogged down in a dignity-driven conflict with the EU over the rule of law ? has forfeited the chance to effectively take Britain?s place in the EU post-Brexit. But it?s not missing the opportunity to be Ukraine?s reliable ally, nor is it losing sight of the geopolitical positives that may ultimately flow from this.

Whether the ruling party is able to hold on to power past the 2023 elections or not, the country?s geopolitical course is steady. In March the Polish parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of granting Ukrainians special rights to Poland?s education, health and labour market. More than 80% of Ukrainians have a good or very good opinion of Poles. Three-quarters say their view has improved since Russia?s invasion. Despite troubled relations up to 1945, Ukrainians perceive Poles as the single most friendly society today.

All major Polish parties support Ukraine but they also hope that, while the arc of the history is long, it will eventually bend towards a new geopolitical order. They want to see Ukraine emerge from this war as a star in the making, Europe?s centuries-old western orientation overturned ? and Poland the undeclared winner."
5,"There is of course no connection, only chance correlation, in the fact the top three teams currently in Europe’s top three leagues are also the last three teams to get rid of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Arsenal, Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund have all passed on Aubameyang, Dortmund quite a long time ago. And while this is simply coincidence, it might make sense at this stage in the striker’s career, and in a sport that is always seeking marginal gains, for his agent to start marketing him on this basis, punting him around top clubs, backed by hard data, on the basis that hiring and then getting rid of Aubameyang has undeniable benefits.
Here is a player who should be treated not as a regular squad member but as the football equivalent of the sacrificial goats the ancient Greeks would take into battle, to be offered up as appeasement to the gods. Sign my client. Alienate him from the squad under an agreed schedule. We guarantee an Aubameyang Uplift of at least three league places between November and March while he posts pictures of his dinner from Dubai. There is a serious point here. At a time of bloated squads and destructive superstars, the ability to get rid of players is almost as vital as the ability to bring them in. Manchester United’s squad has been clogged for years with vaguely familiar faces on mind-boggling contracts. Plus, of course, and most obviously, we have the example of Arsenal, where a part of Mikel Arteta’s success has been tied to his ability to wield the cleaver, to slice away various basking low-value players. A large part of which, arguably day one on the journey from there to here, was the complete exclusion of Mesut Özil from the new era.
With Özil’s retirement from football this week there has been a temptation to draw an Aubameyang-style connection. This time between the final shuffling-off of a wonderful, occasionally maddening footballer, last seen gliding around an unhappy Emirates Stadium like some wide-eyed Victorian ghost accidentally caught on camera behind the summer house, and the simultaneous ratcheting up of Arsenal’s eight-point lead in the Premier League, due reward for Arteta’s new-build team of ferrety, eager, perpetual-motion footballers.

The optics for Özil here aren’t great. And he has duly been sliced and diced and processed through the mania of competing opinion, defined as either fraudulent fancy boy or misunderstood consumptive genius depending on your bent.


This was always going to happen. Odd as it now seems, there have been few more divisive footballers in the last decade, or at least few who have seemed to capture a failing era so perfectly. For the majority of his Arsenal career the wails and yelps around Özil seemed to act as a kind of Viking funeral march for the death of the age of Wenger, the sound of lost, sweating alienated middle-aged men speaking with alarming fluency about their deepest and most feverish fears, as filtered through opinions on a succession of disappointing results. And to be fair a great deal of the unhappiness was justified on the numbers."
6,"Tottenham want to talk to Julian Nagelsmann about succeeding Antonio Conte as their manager. The club are expected to part company with Conte, his tenure gravely undermined last Saturday after an explosive rant about the players, and Nagelsmann has become available after his shock sacking by Bayern Munich.

Nagelsmann has been replaced at Bayern by the former Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, who Spurs had considered as a possible post-Conte option. Tuchel inherits a team that will face Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final and, possibly, Chelsea in the semi-final. Spurs were interested in Nagelsmann in 2021 after they dismissed José Mourinho but he was set on a move to Bayern from RB Leipzig. The 35-year-old won the Bundesliga title in his first season and the team are currently second in the table, one point off the leaders, Borussia Dortmund, who they face in their first game after the international break on 1 April. Nagelsmann, just back from a ski holiday, has been sacked because of erratic results and performances since the restart after the World Cup. He has previously spoken of a desire to one day manage in the Premier League.The Bayern chief executive, Oliver Kahn, said: “We have come to the conclusion that the quality in our squad has come to the fore less and less often. After the World Cup, we have played less successfully and less attractively. The big fluctuations in performance have cast doubt on our goals for this season but also our goals for the future. That is why we have acted now.” The players do not expect Conte to return and the club has begun to check the market for his successor. Mason is a contender to take caretaker charge until the end of the season."
7,"The chief executive of stricken Credit Suisse has said that he shares its employees’ “profound sadness and disappointment” after its emergency takeover by rival UBS earlier this week.

UBS took over Credit Suisse on Sunday in a £2.65bn deal forced through by Swiss authorities amid fears that a failure to protect depositors would kickstart a global banking crisis.

In a letter to staff seen by the Guardian, the Credit Suisse group chief executive, Ulrich Körner, said it had “been an emotional and challenging week for all of us. He thanked employees for their “unwavering commitment and for the support you have given our clients and each other during this difficult time”. Korner said the deal with UBS had been the “only viable option” and it “brings both stability and certainty to our clients and to the market”. Switzerland’s government said earlier this week that Credit Suisse was ordered to temporarily suspend bonus payments awarded in the years up to 2022.

In the letter, Körner acknowledged concerns about the ban among its 45,000-strong workforce and said discussions concerning the matter with Swiss authorities were “ongoing”. There are more than 5,000 Credit Suisse and about 6,000 UBS staff based in London. “We do not yet have an answer, but we know how important this is for many of you,” he said. Korner said that a deal of the scale of the UBS merger would typically take six months to agree, but the emergency transaction had taken just four days, leaving many practicalities unresolved.

He said: “Until the transaction legally closes later this year, we remain two independent banks and must continue to work that way. Please stay focused on our clients and continue to provide them with the outstanding service they expect from us.”

Körner, who become chief executive in July 2022 after former boss Thomas Gottstein was ousted, said he remains “fully committed” to the bank. “I will be at your side as we work to make the transaction a success,” he said.

The UBS deal was agreed after it became clear the $54bn loan to Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank had failed to halt a sharp slide in its share price.

Credit Suisse’s travails have sent jitters through markets. On Friday, banking stocks suffered a sharp sell-off, including Deutsche Bank, which fell as much as 14% before recovering some ground."
